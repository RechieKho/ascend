It is about a tortoise wanderers travel across the vast, never-ending world, in search of honing its skill to the extreme. The game will be a randomized metroidvania, or roguelike that never resets, mixing of generated levels and exploration & progression. This game is currently targeted to be a desktop , singleplayer game (no multiplayer, no multiplatform yet; go away feature freaks). Gameplay / Mechanics Levels The game composes of infinite number of generated level. Each level has its own biome and unique enemies. In a level, there will be a boss enemy for the player to defeat in order to proceed to the next level. The map of the level will be vast so the player will need to venture and explore the terrain to hunt down the boss enemy. Player's control The player can move like a normal 2D platformer (walks left & right, single jump). The player can also do basic attack for all 4 direction (up, down, left and right). Hitting enemies, projectiles and some terrain downward sends the player upward. Health The player will have interger amount of health and damage received will cost 1 to 3 health depending on the damage. The player can use mana to restore health through focusing. Since the levels are vast, there will be checkpoints scattered across the level. On death, player will be respawned to the last checkpoint. Mana Hitting enemies or some special object gains mana. The player will no longer receive mana if the mana is maxed out. Skills For each level passed, the player will grant a new skill. There will have a skill system in which the player can defines its moveset (or skill set) from the list of skills acquired from defeating bosses. Each skill will have its own cooldown and mana cost. The player can only edit moveset at the checkpoints. If you have any uncertainty or suggestion, please open an issue .","title":"Game design document"},{"location":"game-design-document/#game-design-document","text":"As the one-line description said, it is a maze-generating metroidvania game.
